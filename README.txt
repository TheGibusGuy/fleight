GitHub Section:
	- This program is dependent on 
		o SDL2-2.26.3
		o SDL2-image-2.6.3
		o SDL@_ttf-2.20.2

How to play:
	Guide the blue vessel towards green cells, and stay in the air as long as you can.

Controls:
	- (arrows) + (z) to thrust in a given direction.
	- (esc) will go end the game prematurely and send you back to the title screen.

If high_score.txt doesn't have a valid number in it the program will probably crash.

This wouldn't be possible without the tutorials at ==> https://lazyfoo.net/
Thank you Mr. Foo.
